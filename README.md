## Presentation Topic

Topic 1:
Bol.com’s Seller Experience team is looking to expand the number of third party vendors who sell on the site. One problem they are facing is that new vendors have less, and noisier reviews by consumers about their reputation. Propose a new strategy that they could adopt to help new seller’s reputations on Bol.com and an analytical framework that you could use to test whether this strategy is successful.

## Instructions for Students

Upload your essay as a PDF to this repository before the due date.

After your submission, the instructors will upload a grading rubric with information about the group component of your grade.

Information on writing an report instead of a group presentation is as follows:

* Your report is due at the date and time before your Lab Section would begin, i.e. at 10:30AM, OR due to a personalized deadline. 
    * When the submission link is sent to you, we will confirm your due date.
* The report topic will be the same as that your presentation group will be assigned to, and demands the same content.
* Write it as if you were submitting a written document that would be the main point of discussion in a meeting of executives, data scientists and marketing analysts about the assigned topic
* You will have a word limit (maximum) of 1250 words. Your grade is 100% determined by the report's written content, there is no weight assigned to an individual reflection or questions asked during other group presentations.
* Make sure your writing is well structured, answers the question at hand and is not unnecessarily convoluted.      
    * The submission can and should be written in a way that uses headings and subheadings to add clarity for the reader, rather than an un-sectioned essay
